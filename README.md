# Lab

Development environment checklist:

- [Windows](docs/windowsChecklist.md)
- [Linux](docs/linuxChecklist.md)
- [Mac](docs/macChecklist.md)

## Downloading laboratory boilerplate

- Clone repo an move to downloaded folder
 
```terminal
git clone https://gitlab.com/liesner/bts-rtda-lab-5.git
cd bts-rtda-lab-5
```

## Data sets

- The data is a variation of  [population-city](https://github.com/datasets/population-city) data-sets.
    - ```data/city_male_population``` witch contain tha male population distributed by city
    - ```data/city_female_population``` witch contain tha female population distributed by city
- Each comma separate value on the rows of both data sets correspond to the headers: 

```terminal
Country or Area
Year
Area
Sex
City
City type
Record Type
Reliability
Source Year
Value
Value Footnotes
```

## Practical activity

## First some boilerplate explanations

```
app (.)
|   built.sbt   **sbt configuration file, contains all dependency of the app**
|   docker-compose.yaml     **docker-compose configuration file**
|   Dockerfile  **docker build file**
|   Readme.md 
|   deploy.sh **script to submit spark app on local cluster, to be runned inside docker container**
|   Data
|   |  city_male_population **distribute text file dataset with male population by year**
|   |  city_female_population **distribute text file dataset with female population by year**

## Assignment

Note: 
- For all assignment input files will be the same ```data/city_male_population``` and ```data/city_female_population```. You always need to create an output file with the result of operations in the folder ```tmp/```:
    - The app should receive as parameters the input file path "./data/city_female_population" "./data/city_male_population" 
    and the output path "tmp/output_name"    

- Sample of input file
```terminal

- Add the functionality to get total count of females and males grouped by common year component 
(output_name = "total_count_grouped_by_common_year_component")

- Add the functionality to get the distinct cities on female collection (output_name = distinct_city_female)

- Add the functionality to get the distinct cities on both collections (output_name = distinct_city_all).

- Add the functionality to get total count of people, male or female by year (output_name = total_count_by_year)

- Add the functionality to get the total count of people that live on Urban Agglomeration by year.
